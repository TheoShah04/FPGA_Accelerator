# Balance Robot

## Requirements

1. The robot shall demonstrate a form of autonomous behaviour based inputs from a camera and/or other sensors
2. The robot shall balance on two wheels, with a centre of gravity above the axis of rotation of the wheels
3. There shall be remote control interface that allows a user to enable or control the autonomous behaviour, and to move the robot manually in two dimensions around a flat surface
    1. The user interface shall display useful information about the power status of the robot, such as power consumption and remaining battery energy
    2. The user interface shall provide inputs and display information that are pertinent to the demonstrator application.
4. The robot should augment the provided chassis with a head unit that suits the chosen demonstrator application
